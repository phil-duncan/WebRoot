				<p>I've been involved in teaching web design since the mid 90s. One of my favorite things about learning and teaching in technical fields is that things are always changing.  And things have indeed been changing radically over time.  It is important to stay flexible and be voraciously curious, in order to ride the crest of the most recent developments. With this in mind, we are going to cover some cutting edge technology and some tried and true technologies that may be a bit behind the curve.
				</p>

				<p>It is refreshing to keep abreast of improvements and innovations that go into software systems and networks. As someone who enjoys problem solving and building things, I find that software systems and their networks offer endless opportunities for adventure!
				</p>

				<p>One of my top concerns is making sure that systems meet the needs of the user with the most usable interfaces possible. This includes problem solving to design systems based on user needs revealed by sound analysis. So many times systems are designed around the capabilities of the technology and talents of the team, rather than being designed and finely tuned to be accessible, easily usable, and to efficiently perform tasks specifically required by the users.
